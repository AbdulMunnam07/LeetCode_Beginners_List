## 💡 Introduction

Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that operates on sorted arrays or lists. By repeatedly dividing the search space in half, binary search efficiently narrows down the possible locations of a target value, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n).

This repository provides a collection of problems that will help you:

- Understand the mechanics of binary search.
- Learn how to implement binary search in different scenarios.
- Develop problem-solving skills that are essential for coding interviews.
